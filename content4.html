            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm mt-2">This Unity-based game project is currently in development, focusing on game design, level design, and 3D modeling. In its prototype stage, the game allows players to control a ball, navigating through a series of dynamic levels filled with obstacles, puzzles, and challenges to reach the finish line. The prototype features interactive mechanics, such as moving platforms, switches, and environmental hazards, designed to test players' problem-solving skills and reflexes. While the core gameplay is functional, the game is still being refined, with ongoing improvements to level design, 3D assets, and overall polish. The goal is to create an immersive and engaging experience that balances difficulty and fun, with plans to expand content and features in future updates..</p>
